This project conducts a comprehensive comparison of three distinct word vectorization techniques - Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, and GloVe Embeddings - alongside the utilization of BERT, a pre-trained language model, for the classification of tweets into two categories. By employing deep learning and traditional machine learning methods, we aim to discern the optimal approach for tweet classification in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
